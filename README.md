# SGE aims to be a School Management System
We have thought how the database should be. I have carried out the analysis 
and design based on the educational system of my country of residence.
The idea with this is to learn by doing. We will have to think about the 
different views of it with the levels of access to the base. Let's say 
this project he's still in diapers. There are many issues yet to be defined.

After thinking a bit about where to start to enumerate and describe the 
system requirements, I thought it convenient to think about what data and 
how each user would like to see it, in addition to the corresponding 
attributions for registrations, cancellations and/or modifications of 
these data in the future system. However, these users do not need 
(nor do they want) to see all the data, only what is of interest to 
them and what they need for their work. Thus we were able to recognize 
the following users:
- Preceptor
- Professor
- Secretary
- Director
- Administrator

## Vista Preceptor
- ¿Qué desearía ver un preceptor?
